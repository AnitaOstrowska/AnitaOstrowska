- 👋 Hi, I'm @AnitaOstrowska

- 👀 I'm interested in testing and quality assurance.
Learning new technology skills is fun and rewarding for me. 
I love swimming, DIY (scrapbooking, sewing) and spending fun time with my loved ones.   

- 🌱 I completed my postgraduate studies in Software Engineering at Poznań University of Technology.
Currently I'm in the Dare IT mentoring program, during which I work on my QA / Testing skills together with my mentor (Agnieszka Kłosowska - QA Team Leader at mTab Sp. z o.o.). 

- 💞️ I am looking for a job as a tester: manual tester, software tester and in the future automation tester.
